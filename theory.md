### Introduction<br>
Surveying or land surveying is the technique, profession, art, and science of determining the terrestrial or three-dimensional positions of points and the distances and angles between them. A land surveying professional is called a land surveyor. These points are usually on the surface of the Earth, and they are often used to establish maps and boundaries for ownership, locations, such as building corners or the surface location of subsurface features, or other purposes required by government or civil law, such as property sales. You can look at the lecture notes, browse through slides, and also see an animation that can run several examples.<br>

This experiment is useful to study all the equipments used for surveying as well as for auto level. It contains the audio, visual as well as the cross sectional view and description of each part of equipment.<br>

An auto level, an automatic level is a professional leveling tool that is often used by land surveyors, builders, contractors, and engineers. And it’s best known for its ability to provide consistent level accuracy more quickly than many other leveling instruments. It’s usually placed on a tripod, where it’s calibrated to a level position with leveling screws. The person operating the device then looks through the telescope that’s attached to the instrument, while a second person holds a graduated staff or tape measure at the position that needs to be measured.<br>


### An auto level can be used in many different applications, which can include but may not be limited to:<br>

1) Structural framework.<br>
2) Establishing proper drainage systems.<br>
3) Determining the correct elevation of floors.<br>
4) Establishing the proper height for doors and windows.<br>
5) Developing suspended ceilings.<br>


### The steps to calibrate an auto level:<br>
1. Place the instrument on a tripod, while pointing it at the collimator.<br>
2. Turn the leveling screws to make sure they can move freely.<br>
3. Look at the bubble vial to make sure the bubble isn’t larger than the circle.<br>
4. Move the bubble to the center of the circle by using two of the three leveling screws.<br>
5. Make sure the bubble stays center at 90, 180, 270, and 360 degrees.<br>
6. Rotate the eyepiece focusing knob to both extremes, while focusing on the instrument’s cross hair (or reticle).<br>
7. Rotate the focus knob so it’s first on close up and then on infinity to make sure the movement is smooth and even.<br>
8. With the focus set to infinity, check the cross hair of the instrument to make sure it matches with the reticle on the collimator.<br>
9. Use the adjusting screw next to the eyepiece to move the cross hair up and down until it matches with the collimator.<br>
